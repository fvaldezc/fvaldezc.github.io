                    Developed expertise in Computer-based Simulations of semiconductor components (resistors, capacitors, diodes, chips, and other circuit blocks) using one of the best industry software simulators
                    such as LT Spice and Open source simulator Ngspice. These software tools used to simulate or to observe the working behavior from a single component to the working behavior of more complex circuit 
                    blocks that are part of Mobile Chargers Products. The use and application of such tools (simulation software) impacted in the product designs of Wireless Charger Modules and Wire Charger Modules as follows:

                      Provided valuable information (component electrical values) that is key to choose between many options and have the best (best performance and price) components produced by the semiconductor suppliers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Produced Error Detection in component selection at early stages of Product Designs.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Generated cost reductions (thousands of dollars) by avoiding design modifications occurrences appear in products (e.g. mobile chargers) at advanced stages of validation and final testings due mistakes not seen at early stages of design. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Created Big Influence in Semiconductor Industry (Semiconductor Suppliers) by providing current simulation information of components used in different products and applications, providing a valuable input for suppliers in order to create/modify the best Semiconductors for the Automotive Industry.

                  <li>
                    Successfully found alternating electronic parts (chips most of the cases) needed due the current shortages in the market and changes in the supply chain of components, keeping the current production ongoing, saving thousands of dollars avoiding redesigns (modification of current design) and delays.
                  </li>
                </br>
                <li>
                  Successfully working with Xpedition package creating/updating schematics, generating new BOMs for different versions of the project, analyzing/debugging errors in 
                  Schematics and PCBs. Previous experience in Lay out of components and layout of circuit. Applying techniques to minimize EMC interferences, minimizing noise 
                  (low impedance), and avoiding high temperatures in key regions by incrementing the width of thickness of traces and other recommendations by PCB suppliers and 
                  internal recommendations of the product.

                  <li>
                    Led in the WCCA (Worst Case Circuit Analysis) creation for American automotive brands (such as Ford, Stellantis, GM and others) of mobile (wire and wireless) chargers. The WCCAs provide to the designers and customers 
                    the worst case scenarios with values (maximum and minimum values) where the components in circuits are capable to work properly as planned in the design. This WCCAs have the purpose to avoiding problems when the product 
                    is being tested on Validation or at further stages of product development. 
                    These calculations provides confidence and quality in the final product. These analysis saves thousands of dollars and saves delays in time for delivering the final product.

                  <li>
                    Experienced in the creation of Functional safety documentation for mobile chargers such as Failure Mode, Effects and diagnostics Analysis (more known as FMEDA) and Failure Tree Analysis
                   (more known as FTA). Either the FMEDA (that is a component by component analysis showing the risks an end-user can face when when interacting with the product and how the system is prepared to 
                   diminish or avoid completely such risks) or the FTA (that is a analysis showing there root cause of risks occurring in the product), have the purpose to avoid accidents and risks to final users 
                   interacting with such automotive products.

                      Developed Expertise in the implementation of functional tests of Body Control Module (more known as BCMs) by using top level tools such as CAN/LIN Analyzer (Vector Brand). Such tests are performed by sending messages to the main module, then the module starts responding accordingly, providing a good way to verify and see the performance of the module. Most of these functional tests are performed during firmware upgrades, component changes or any modification made to the module. As an example of a functional test that found a bad unit in an Body control module (BCM) provoking a motorcycle to turn on with no reason more than a metal debris inside the module. It was making contact on an integrating circuit responsable to turn on the motorcycle.
